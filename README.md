# PS1/X Rick Roll
### Because why not, I got bored

Created using excelent examples and instructions by [ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds](https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds), definitely go check them out.\
I bought PS1... and I wanted to do something more than glitching with it, so here it is :D\
I wanted to add scrolling/wave text and sprites but it's really late. The code is two examples smushed together with couple edits, so it is what it is...\
\
There's .bin/.cue file, so you can burn it and give it to somebody who has chipped console and rick roll them :D\
